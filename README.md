# NodeJS Swarm Intelligence
NodeJS implementation of Swarm Intelligence algorithms

## Swarm Intelligence
Swarm intelligence (SI) is the collective behavior of decentralized, 
self-organized systems, natural or artificial.
SI systems consist typically of a population of simple agents or boids 
interacting locally with one another and with their environment. 
The inspiration often comes from nature, especially biological systems.
